# aoc-2017-rust
A collection of solutions to Advent of Code problems in Rust.

## Getting started
First, make sure you have rust installed.  The recommended way to do this is via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/) but there are
[other options](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html) as well.

`rustup` will install both the Rust compiler (`rustc`) and the Rust package manager (`cargo`). You can
use `rustc` by itself if you'd like, but it's usually simpler to just use `cargo`.

To run any of these solutions, `cd` into the solution directory (for example `day-1/problem-1`) and then
simply run `cargo run` to both compile and run the binary.
